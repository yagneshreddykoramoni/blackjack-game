Blackjack is a simple card game to play online. Click "Start Game" to begin, drawing two random cards (1-11). If their sum is 21, you hit Blackjack and win! If the sum exceeds 21, you're out. If it's less than 21, keep drawing cards until you either reach 21 or bust. Aim to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
