Blackjack is a simple card game you can play online. Here's how it works:

1. *Start Game*: Click the "Start Game" button to begin.
2. *Draw Cards*: The game picks two random cards, each numbered between 1 and 11.
3. *Check Sum*:
    - If the sum of the two cards equals 21, you hit Blackjack and win!
    - If the sum exceeds 21, you're out of the game.
    - If the sum is less than 21, you can choose to draw a new card.

The goal is to reach a sum as close to 21 as possible without going over. Keep drawing cards strategically to avoid busting!
